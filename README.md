# Azure Resources

This is a (mostly) notes-based repository for my studies about the (arguably) the most essential azure resources whose fundamentals I should know about.

The current roadmap for resources is:

- [ ] Azure Virtual Machines (in progress)
- [ ] Azure Storage Accounts
- [ ] Azure Virtual Network
- [ ] Azure Active Directory
- [ ] AzureSQL Database
- [ ] App Service
- [ ] Azure Functions
- [ ] Azure Load Balancer
- [ ] Azure Traffic Manager
- [ ] Azure Container Instances (ACI)
- [ ] Azure Service Bus
- [ ] Azure DevOps (already good at it)
- [ ] Azure Bicep (already studied a bit)
- [ ] Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) (use it everyday at work)
- [ ] Azure Cosmos DB

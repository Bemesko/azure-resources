# Azure Resources

This is a (mostly) notes-based repository for my studies about (arguably) the most essential Azure resources whose fundamentals I should know about.

Most of these I already have to deal with in one form or another in my day job, however the knowledge you get by practicing directly usually comes top-down, hence the initiative to study these things in a bottom-up fashion.

The current roadmap for resources is:

- [ ] [Virtual Machines](virtual-machines.md) (in progress)
- [ ] [Virtual Networks](networking.md)
- [ ] [Azure Load Balancer](azure-load-balancer)
- [ ] [Azure Traffic Manager](azure-traffic-manager)
- [ ] [Azure AD](azure-ad)
- [ ] [Azure App Service](azure-app-service)
- [ ] [Azure Functions](azure-functions)
- [ ] [Storage Accounts](storage-accounts)
- [ ] [Azure SQL Database](azure-sql)
- [ ] [Azure Cosmos DB](azure-cosmos-db)
- [ ] [Azure Container Instances](azure-container-instances)
- [ ] [Azure Service Bus](azure-service-bus)
- [ ] [Azure DevOps](azure-devops) (advanced topics I don't usually deal with in a day to day basis)
- [ ] [Azure Bicep](azure-bicep) (and how to be productive with it)
- [ ] [Azure Kubernetes Service](azure-kubernetes-service) (expand knowledge from bottom up)
